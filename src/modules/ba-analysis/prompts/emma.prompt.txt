[OUTPUT STRUCTURE]
- Summary of strengths or compliant areas (if any).
- List of issues: duplicates, conflicts, missing acceptance criteria, or unclear items. One line per point; optionally cite section or quote.
- Short list format (bullets or numbered). No long paragraphs.

[CONSTRAINTS]
Be concise. Only report what you find in the document; do not invent content. Use evidence (e.g. quote or section) when flagging issues.
